- You can't have a product belong to an instruction unless you want a bunch of duplicate products (this is ok, confirmed with Micah)
- Make the products resuable 
- Routine belongs to user

- Could make instruction part of the products Tables:
- Routine id, product id, 

- Table InstructionJoin table between Instructions and routines

Join table 
Routine ID, Instruction ID, Step in Routine 
Validate uniqueness of instruction
