Models:
User: has_many_routines, has_many products through routines
Routine: belongs to user, has many instructions, has many products
Product - Belongs to routine, has many user through routine

Have a user have a list of products

Tables:

- t.string :username
- t.string :email address
- t.string :password_digest

Routines:
- t.string :name
- t.string :description 
- t.text :products (a collection of products used in the routine) (will try to use erb tags + OL to list out the products in order)

Products:
- t.string :name
- t.string :category
- t.integer :routine_id (associates a product to a routine)

- A routine belongs to a user
- You can't have a product belong to an instruction unless you want a bunch of duplicate products (this is ok, confirmed with Micah)
- Make the products resuable 
- Routine belongs to user 




- Each user has a routine, each routine has instructions 
- Could make instruction part of the products Tables:
- Routine id, product id, 

- Table InstructionJoin table between Instructions and routines

Join table 
Routine ID, Instruction ID, Step in Routine 
Validate uniqueness of instruction



User Interface
- Want to allow user to sign up/login ('/signup', '/login')
   - By signing up, I'm creating a new user
   - By logging in, I'm creating a new session
- Index Page to welcome user - DONE
- Create user in DB and Model - DONE
- Want to allow user to create new routine / persist routine to database
- Set up CSS - done

Sessions: What allow us to handle user authentication and authorization - DONE
   - When we enable session + set an appropriate key, we get a hash
   - We can write info into that hash, hash will be persisted via sending cookies to user to live in web browser
   - cookies are secured + encrypted, signed with session secret key -> any info sent to browser is unreadable and unable to be changed
