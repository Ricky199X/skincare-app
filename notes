Models:
User: has_many_routines, has_many products through routines
Routine: belongs to user, has many instructions, has many products
Product - Belongs to routine, has many user through routine

Have a user have a list of products

Tables:

User:
- t.string :username
- t.string :email address
- t.string :password_digest

Routines:
- t.string :name
- t.string :description 
- t.text :products (a collection of products used in the routine) (will try to use erb tags + OL to list out the products in order)
- t.integer :user_id -> (foreign key to associate with user)

Products:
- t.string :name
- t.string :category
- t.integer :routine_id (associates a product to a routine)


Views
- Routines
   - new.erb
   - edit.erb
   - show.erb
   - routines.erb

- Users
   - new_user.erb
   - login.erb
   - show.erb


- A routine belongs to a user
- You can't have a product belong to an instruction unless you want a bunch of duplicate products (this is ok, confirmed with Micah)
- Make the products resuable 
- Routine belongs to user 


- Each user has a routine, each routine has instructions 
- Could make instruction part of the products Tables:
- Routine id, product id, 

- Table InstructionJoin table between Instructions and routines

Join table 
Routine ID, Instruction ID, Step in Routine 
Validate uniqueness of instruction



User Interface
- Want to allow user to sign up/login ('/signup', '/login')
   - By signing up, I'm creating a new user
   - By logging in, I'm creating a new session
- Index Page to welcome user - DONE
- Create user in DB and Model - DONE
- Want to allow user to create new routine / persist routine to database - DONE
- Set up CSS - done

Sessions: What allow us to handle user authentication and authorization - DONE
   - When we enable session + set an appropriate key, we get a hash
   - We can write info into that hash, hash will be persisted via sending cookies to user to live in web browser
   - cookies are secured + encrypted, signed with session secret key -> any info sent to browser is unreadable and unable to be changed


To-do's:
Having trouble displaying a user's routines on their homepage

Priorities
1. Post users routines on index page (may not be able to do this w partial - needs to show routine.name of each routine) - DONE
2. Routine show View (needs to be an ordered list with clickable link to each product) 
3. User needs to be able to create routine, then be redirect to their index of routines
4. Product Views (show, new, index, edit)

User flow
1. Sign up/login - done
2. User homepage: "Hey user, here are a list of your most recent routines (each routine is clickable)
3. There's a menu up top with "home", "routines", "products"
   - Home is just homepage 
   - Routines is an index of all their routines
   - Products is a repo of products in the database + their descriptions (links are clickable, products can be individually added to a routine)
4.
